# Grussauftraege-KFR
This project contains a collection of letters from the 18th and 19th centuries, primarily from August Wilhelm von Schlegel and the early Romantic period. The data is structured to facilitate the analysis of social networks and communication patterns among historical figures. *Grußaufträge*, i.e. requests to an intermediary to greet one or more third persons, are a common feature in these letters, and the project aims to analyze these requests to understand the social dynamics of the time.

# Data
The source-data came from two collections of letters: a collection of letters from August Wilhelm von Schlegel (https://august-wilhelm-schlegel.de/briefedigital/), and a collection of letters from the early Romantic period (https://briefe-der-romantik.de/). The data has been processed to extract relevant information for network analysis.
The data is organized into the following directories:
- `network_degree`: Contains CSV files with network degree data, which includes information about the connections between individuals in the letters.
- `network_diagram`: Contains PNG files with visual representations of the networks derived from the letters
